# Hi, I'm John

Below, you will find some of my personal software engineering projects. I primarily work in full-stack JavaScript (React and Vue on the front-end), but I'm always looking to learn new tech. Recently, I've been getting into TypeScript.

## Projects:
### [Deckr](https://github.com/FSA-Deckr/deckr)
Deckr is virtual multiplayer card table with in-game video chat. It posed an interesting problem in delivering a multiplayer game where players require a synchronized environment and state (especially when dealing with the randomness of in-game physics!).
- Tech: Node, Express, Vanilla JavaScript, Phaser 3, socket.io, and Heroku
